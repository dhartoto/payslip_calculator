folder with payslip information (name, pay period, gross income, income tax, net
income, and super)

Assumptions:
- "payment start date" should actually be pay period as illustrated in the input
  example.
- Application is only required to calculate full months.
- Input/Output are in csv
- Application require error validation for correct number of inputs, salary
  with positive integer, super rate between 0 to 50% (inclusive)
- all super rate in the input file ends with '%'

Instructions:

David,Rudd,60050,9%,01 March – 31 March

2. To run the application enter 'ruby payslips.rb' from the applications root directory.

program.
